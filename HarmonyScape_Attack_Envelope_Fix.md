# HarmonyScape Attack Envelope Fix
*Date: Current*

## Issue Description
The attack envelope was not functioning correctly, causing clicks/pops at note onset. The main issues were:
1. Envelope level was initialized to 0.01f instead of 0.0f
2. Attack rate calculation was too aggressive (multiplied by 0.5f)
3. Voice trigger method didn't properly reset envelope state

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Envelope Initialization in SpatialEngine.cpp
- Changed all instances of `voice.envelopeLevel = 0.01f` to `voice.envelopeLevel = 0.0f`
- This ensures the envelope starts from silence and ramps up smoothly

### 2. Corrected Attack Rate Calculation
```cpp
// Before:
envelopeIncrement = 1.0f / (adsr.attack * static_cast<float>(sampleRate) * 0.5f);

// After:
envelopeIncrement = 1.0f / (adsr.attack * static_cast<float>(sampleRate));
```
- Removed the 0.5f multiplier that was making attack times incorrect
- Added proper handling for zero attack time to avoid clicks

### 3. Updated Voice Trigger Method in Voice.h
```cpp
void trigger(int newNote, float newPosition, int newChordPosition)
{
    // ... existing code ...
    envelopeLevel = 0.0f;  // Always start at 0 for proper attack
    phase = 0.0f;          // Reset oscillator phase
    // ... existing code ...
}
```
- Ensures envelope level and oscillator phase are properly reset on each trigger

### 4. Cleanup
- Removed `SpatialEngine.cpp.bak` backup file

## Testing Instructions
1. Open the plugin in Ableton or your preferred DAW
2. Test various attack times (0ms to 2000ms)
3. Play rapid notes to test voice stealing
4. Check for clicks/pops at note onset
5. Verify attack time matches the parameter value

## Next Priority Tasks

### High Priority (Complete MVP)
1. **Implement Preset System**
   - Add save/load functionality
   - Create 20+ factory presets as specified
   - Implement preset browser in UI

2. **Add Step Sequencer**
   - Internal chord progression sequencer
   - Sync to host tempo
   - Basic pattern editing

3. **Implement MIDI Export**
   - Export generated voicings as MIDI
   - Drag-and-drop to DAW functionality

4. **Improve Chord Voicing Algorithm**
   - Add proper voice leading
   - Implement genre-specific voicings
   - Add chord extensions beyond basic octaves

### Medium Priority
1. Add spatial visualization in UI
2. Implement more sophisticated voice allocation
3. Add parameter tooltips
4. Optimize CPU usage further

## Build Status
âœ… Project builds successfully on macOS with:
- VST3 format
- AU format  
- Standalone application
