# HarmonyScape Complete Envelope Fix Summary
*Date: Current*

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Long Sustain Problem
**Root Cause**: The ChordEngine was not properly handling note-off messages. It only sent note-offs for generated voicing when ALL input notes were released, causing notes to sustain indefinitely.

**Fix**: Modified `ChordEngine::processMidi()` to:
- Track note-off messages separately
- Send note-offs for all generated voicing notes whenever ANY input note is released
- Handle single notes properly (previously required at least 2 notes)

### 2. Attack Envelope Issues
**Previous Fix**: Already corrected initialization and attack rate calculation
- Changed envelope initialization from 0.01f to 0.0f
- Removed 0.5f multiplier from attack rate calculation
- Added proper phase reset in Voice trigger

### 3. Note Tracking
**Improvement**: Better handling of note-on/note-off tracking to ensure proper envelope release behavior

## New Feature: ADSR Visualizer

Added a minimalist ADSR envelope visualizer with:
- Real-time visualization of envelope shape
- Clean design with cyan curve on dark background
- White circles at control points (attack peak, decay/sustain level, release start)
- Grid lines for reference
- Labels for each stage (A, D, S, R)
- Updates in real-time as parameters change

### Implementation Details
- Created `ADSRVisualizer` class as inner component of `PluginEditor`
- Positioned to the left of ADSR sliders
- Updates at 24Hz via timer callback
- Scales dynamically based on total envelope time

## Testing Instructions

1. **Test Note Release**:
   - Play a chord and release individual notes
   - All generated voicing should release immediately
   - No more infinite sustain

2. **Test Single Notes**:
   - Play single notes - they should generate voicing
   - Release should work properly

3. **Test ADSR Visualizer**:
   - Adjust each ADSR parameter
   - Visualizer should update in real-time
   - Curve should accurately represent envelope shape

4. **Test Attack**:
   - Set different attack times
   - Should hear smooth fade-in without clicks
   - Attack time should match parameter value

## Code Changes Summary

### ChordEngine.cpp
- Added note-off tracking
- Modified to handle single notes
- Fixed note-off propagation to all voicing notes

### SpatialEngine.cpp
- Previously fixed attack initialization
- Proper envelope state management

### Voice.h
- Added phase reset on trigger
- Proper envelope level initialization

### PluginEditor.h/cpp
- Added ADSRVisualizer component
- Integrated into UI layout
- Real-time parameter updates

## Build Status
✅ Successfully builds with minor warnings (unused parameters, float conversions)
✅ All formats compile: VST3, AU, Standalone

## Next Steps
1. Test thoroughly in Ableton
2. Consider adding envelope stage indicators (showing current stage during playback)
3. Implement remaining MVP features (presets, sequencer, MIDI export)
