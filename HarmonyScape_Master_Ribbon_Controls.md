# HarmonyScape Master Ribbon Controls

## üéØ NEW ELEGANT DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

Instead of complex individual controls for each ribbon, HarmonyScape now features **5 Master Controls** that intelligently manage all ribbons through sophisticated algorithms. This creates an intuitive, creative experience where every knob movement produces musically interesting results.

## üéµ THE 5 MASTER CONTROLS

### 1. **PULSE** üß° (Orange Knob)
- **What it does**: Controls overall rhythmic energy and speed
- **Range**: 0.0-1.0 
- **Effect**: 
  - Low values = Slow, dreamy arpeggiation (1-3 Hz)
  - High values = Fast, energetic arpeggiation (up to 9 Hz)
  - Automatically adjusts gate length (faster = shorter notes for clarity)
- **Algorithm**: Each ribbon gets slightly different rates based on variation setting

### 2. **VARIATION** üíõ (Yellow Knob)  
- **What it does**: How much the ribbons differ from each other (seed-based)
- **Range**: 0.0-1.0
- **Effect**:
  - Low values = All ribbons similar, unified movement
  - High values = Each ribbon has unique patterns, rates, and behaviors
  - Changes arpeggiation patterns (Up, Down, Outside, Inside, Random, Cascade, Spiral)
- **Algorithm**: Uses seed value to consistently generate different but musical variations

### 3. **WOBBLE** üíö (Lime Knob)
- **What it does**: Spatial movement and timing modulation  
- **Range**: 0.0-1.0
- **Effect**:
  - Low values = Static, precise timing
  - High values = Timing offsets, spatial movement, organic feel
  - Affects spatial spread and ribbon timing offsets
- **Algorithm**: Creates staggered timing and dynamic spatial positioning

### 4. **SWING** üíú (Magenta Knob)
- **What it does**: Global groove feel applied to all ribbons
- **Range**: 0.0-1.0  
- **Effect**:
  - 0.0 = Straight, mechanical timing
  - 1.0 = Heavy swing feel (up to 40% swing on off-beats)
  - Applies to all ribbons simultaneously for unified groove
- **Algorithm**: Delays every other note in each ribbon by swing percentage

### 5. **SHIMMER** ü©µ (Light Blue Knob)
- **What it does**: High-frequency sparkle and complexity
- **Range**: 0.0-1.0
- **Effect**:
  - Low values = Consistent, predictable behavior
  - High values = Velocity variations, intensity changes, shimmer effects
  - Affects note decay and intensity randomization
- **Algorithm**: Adds musical randomization to velocity and sustain

## üéõÔ∏è SUPPORTING CONTROLS

### **Count** (Cyan Knob)
- **Range**: 1-5 ribbons
- **Effect**: How many ribbons are active simultaneously
- More ribbons = More complex polyrhythmic patterns

### **Enable Ribbons** (Toggle)
- Master on/off switch for the entire ribbon system

---

## üß† HOW THE ALGORITHM WORKS

### Intelligent Ribbon Assignment:
1. **Count** determines how many ribbons are active (1-5)
2. **Variation** acts as a seed to ensure consistent but different behaviors
3. Each ribbon gets:
   - Unique rate based on **Pulse** + **Variation**
   - Unique pattern based on **Variation** + ribbon index
   - Timing offset based on **Wobble**
   - Same **Swing** for unified groove
   - Randomized intensity based on **Shimmer**

### Musical Intelligence:
- Patterns are mathematically distributed across the 7 types
- Rates are musically spaced (not random)
- Timing offsets create polyrhythmic complexity
- Gate lengths adapt to rate for clarity
- Velocity variations maintain musical dynamics

## üöÄ USING THE SYSTEM CREATIVELY

### **Basic Workflow:**
1. **Play a chord** (e.g., C-E-G-B for Cmaj7)
2. **Enable Ribbons** 
3. **Set Count** to 2-3 for starts
4. **Adjust Pulse** for desired speed
5. **Increase Variation** for complexity
6. **Add Wobble** for organic movement
7. **Dial in Swing** for groove
8. **Touch Shimmer** for sparkle

### **Creative Techniques:**
- **Low Pulse + High Variation** = Slow, evolving textures
- **High Pulse + Low Variation** = Fast, unified arpeggiation  
- **Medium Pulse + High Wobble** = Organic, shifting patterns
- **Any setting + Swing** = Instant groove transformation
- **High Shimmer** = Unpredictable, sparkly textures

## ‚ú® MUSICAL RESULTS

This system produces:
- **Clean Arpeggiation**: One note per ribbon at a time
- **Polyrhythmic Complexity**: Up to 5 independent rhythmic voices
- **Musical Intelligence**: All combinations sound good
- **Creative Control**: Intuitive knobs that encourage experimentation
- **Consistent Results**: Same settings always produce same patterns
- **Infinite Variety**: Millions of possible combinations
